## Initial Project Setup
- [x] Collect available stats for current parts for "history"
- [ ] Design UI
- [x] Decide Database


## Project Making
- [ ] A reason why it lags so much between switching categories (not sub-categories) is because it over writes the old list of parts from the other category (I'm pretty sure). 

- [ ] Make it so when you select another part tab, it automatically goes to the stats of the equipped part

- [ ] Compare parts list, add little compare button to add to list

- [ ] Create app for updating data in database

- [ ] Documentation (for future api)

- [ ] Feature: Version History (for balance patches)
Note: versions organized by database names (Ex. "ACDatabasePreRelease") 

- [ ] Add description for all stats

- [ ] Polish UI
    - [ ] Powered by Armored Core Legacy logo

- [ ] Feature: Save Builds and Load

- [ ] Feature: Paint Jobs and Emblems for Parts

- [ ] Page: Announcements page for blogs and announcement

- [ ] Feature/Page: Ability to upload and share builds and screenshots
    - [ ] When people upload/share, make sure all weapon stats are correct and formatting is correct
        - [ ] Ability to chose which patch they uploading for
    - [ ] Filter through builds based on stats


## Future Goals
- [ ] Move build page off page.js to make room for navigation page or something similar
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Video Previews
- [ ] Accounts?
- [ ] Host tournament information and leaderboards --> maybe just migrate to liquipedia
- [ ] API
